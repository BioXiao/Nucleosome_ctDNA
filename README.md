# Inferring expressed genes by whole-genome sequencing of plasma DNA

The analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in plasma represents a rapidly 
advancing field in medicine. cfDNA consists predominantly of nucleosome-protected
 DNA shed into the bloodstream by cells undergoing apoptosis. We performed whole-genome
 sequencing (WGS) of plasma DNA and identified two discrete regions at transcription 
start sites (TSS) where the nucleosome occupancy results in different read-depth coverage
 patterns in expressed and silent genes. By employing machine learning for gene classification,
 we found that the plasma DNA read depth patterns from healthy donors reflected the expression 
signature of hematopoietic cells. In cancer patients with metastatic disease, we were able to
 classify expressed cancer driver genes in regions with somatic copy number gains with high accuracy.
 We could even determine the expressed isoform of genes with several TSSs as confirmed by RNA-Seq 
of the matching primary tumor. 
Our analyses provide functional information about the cells releasing their DNA into the circulation.


This is a collection of scripts which were used to analyse whole-genome sequencing of non-cancer controls
as well as tumor samples.
